    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish popular in South Asia, made with rice, meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef), prawn or fish and spices. To cater to vegetarians, vegetables or paneer can be substituted for the meat.[1] Sometimes eggs or potatoes are also added.</p>
    <p>Biryani is one of the most popular dishes among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population. Similar dishes are also prepared in Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.</p>
    <p>The exact origin of the dish is uncertain, however, it is speculated to have originated in South Asia or Persia, (now Iran). In North India, different varieties of biryani developed.</p>
