    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 ounce soft French cheese, such as BoursinÂ® cheese (any flavor), crumbled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong>Whisk eggs, water, salt, and pepper together in a bowl until yolks and whites are completely combined and eggs are light and frothy, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong>Melt butter in an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. Pour eggs into skillet and stir rapidly for 20 to 30 seconds until eggs are just starting to set. Spread top of eggs in an even layer and let cook until just slightly underdone and shiny. If necessary, move extra raw egg around to the edges of the skillet. Lower heat to medium-low to prevent browning, if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong>Sprinkle cheese down the middle of the omelet, along with 2 teaspoons chives. Fold one side over the cheese in the middle, followed by the other side, so the omelet is folded in thirds. Remove to a plate and sprinkle with remaining chives.</li>                                           
    </ol>
