# odin-recipes

The current project is about creating a simple html website about recipes. It has four webpages including the home page. The homepage contains a title, a heading and 3 relative links which lead to the respective webpages of the 3 recipies. The webpages contain an image of the finished recipe, a description, an unordered list of ingredients, an ordered list of steps to prepare it and a link back to the homepage.

The project solidified many concepts such as maintaining the appropriate folder structure, using different elemants and tags, and was a good exercise for getting in a decent amount of practice especially with regards to practising the git commands and developing an understanding for them. 

Doing the project also made me realize that I should be more mindful of putting in the closing tabs.
